# Vector Operations Project
This project provides a set of classes and functions for performing various operations on 3D vectors.

# Classes
## GeomVector
The GeomVector class represents a 3D vector and provides the following operations:

1. equalityCheck(): Checks equality with another vector.
2. magnitude(): Calculates the magnitude of the vector.
3. normalize(): Normalizes the vector.
4. setVectorLength(): Sets the length of the vector.
5. addScalar(), subtractScalar(), multiplyScalar(), divideScalar(): Scalar operations on the vector.
6. addVector(): Adds another vector to this vector.
7. dotProduct(): Calculates the dot product with another vector.
8. crossProduct(): Calculates the cross product with another vector.
9. directionCosines(): Calculates the direction cosines of the vector.
10. multiplyMatrix(): Multiplies the vector by a matrix.
11. distanceBetweenVectors(): Calculates the distance between two vectors.
12. distanceBetweenVectorAndPlane(): Calculates the distance between the vector and a plane.
13. angleBetweenVectors(): Calculates the angle between two vectors.
14. angleBetweenVectorAndAxis(): Calculates the angle between the vector and an axis.
15. angleBetweenVectorAndPlane(): Calculates the angle between the vector and a plane.
16. projectionOnVector(): Projects the vector onto another vector.
17. projectionOnPlane(): Projects the vector onto a plane.

## Other Classes
1. TxtWriter: A utility class for writing vectors to a text file.
2. Matrix: A class representing a 3x3 matrix.
3. Plane: A class representing a plane in 3D space.
4. Point3D: A base class representing a point in 3D space.
5. UserInput: A utility class for handling user input.
6. VectorContainer: A class for managing a collection of vectors.

# Inheritance
The GeomVector class is inherited from the Point3D class, which provides basic functionality for representing a point in 3D space.
